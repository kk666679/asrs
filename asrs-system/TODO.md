# Phase 1 Implementation TODO

## 1. Install Additional Dependencies
- [x] Add NextAuth.js for authentication
- [x] Add bcryptjs for password hashing and @types/bcryptjs
- [x] Add zod for validation
- [x] Add testing libraries (Jest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom)
- [x] Add @types/uuid for UUID types
- [x] Run npm install to install all dependencies

## 2. Database Setup
- [ ] Create .env file with DATABASE_URL and other environment variables
- [ ] Generate Prisma client (npx prisma generate)
- [ ] Push schema to database (npx prisma db push)
- [ ] Verify database connection

## 3. TypeScript Types
- [ ] Create types/item.ts for Item, BinItem, Supplier types
- [ ] Create types/location.ts for Warehouse, Zone, Aisle, Rack, Bin types
- [ ] Create types/movement.ts for Movement types
- [ ] Create types/shipment.ts for Shipment, ShipmentItem types
- [ ] Create types/user.ts for User types
- [ ] Create types/api.ts for API request/response types
- [ ] Create types/index.ts to export all types

## 4. Database Configuration
- [ ] Set up lib/db.ts for Prisma client initialization
- [ ] Set up lib/auth.ts for authentication utilities
- [ ] Set up lib/utils.ts for common utility functions
- [ ] Set up lib/validations.ts for Zod schemas

## 5. API Routes Implementation
- [ ] Implement /api/items/route.ts (GET, POST)
- [ ] Implement /api/items/[id]/route.ts (GET, PUT, DELETE)
- [ ] Implement /api/locations/route.ts (GET, POST)
- [ ] Implement /api/locations/[id]/route.ts (GET, PUT, DELETE)
- [ ] Implement /api/transactions/route.ts (POST for movements)
- [ ] Implement /api/putaway/route.ts (POST for smart putaway)
- [ ] Implement /api/picking/route.ts (POST for optimized picking)
- [ ] Implement /api/analytics/inventory/route.ts (GET for analytics)
- [ ] Implement /api/shipments/route.ts (GET, POST)
- [ ] Implement /api/shipments/[id]/route.ts (GET, PUT, DELETE)

## 6. Business Logic
- [ ] Implement basic putaway algorithm (simple bin selection based on capacity and compatibility)
- [ ] Implement picking optimization (route-based picking for multiple items)
- [ ] Add inventory management logic (stock levels, reorder points)
- [ ] Implement movement tracking and status updates

## 7. Authentication & Security
- [ ] Set up NextAuth.js configuration
- [ ] Implement role-based access control middleware
- [ ] Add basic rate limiting
- [ ] Implement input validation and sanitization

## 8. Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for utility functions
- [ ] Write unit tests for API routes
- [ ] Write integration tests for database operations
- [ ] Set up test database and fixtures

## 9. Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation in README.md
- [ ] Add inline code comments throughout the codebase
- [ ] Create usage examples
- [ ] Update project structure documentation
