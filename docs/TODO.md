# TypeScript Build Errors Fix Plan

## Information Gathered
- **auth.service.ts**: Password field type errors due to outdated Prisma client types
- **prisma.service.ts**: Invalid 'beforeExit' event for $on method
- **robotics.ts**: Multiple issues including missing required fields, incorrect model names (shipment vs shipments), wrong property access (commands vs robot_commands), and type mismatches

## Key Technical Concepts
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL database
- NestJS service classes with dependency injection
- TypeScript strict typing with generated Prisma types
- Database schema with enums and relations

## Relevant Files
- backend/src/modules/auth/auth.service.ts
- backend/src/prisma.service.ts
- backend/src/services/robotics.ts
- backend/prisma/schema.prisma

## Plan
- [x] Regenerate Prisma client to fix type mismatches
- [x] Fix $on event in prisma.service.ts
- [x] Fix missing required fields in robotics.ts create operations
- [x] Fix incorrect model name (shipment -> shipments)
- [x] Fix property access (commands -> robot_commands)
- [x] Fix type mismatches in robotics.ts

## Dependent Files to be edited
- backend/src/prisma.service.ts
- backend/src/services/robotics.ts

## Followup steps
- [x] Run prisma generate after fixes
- [x] Test the build after fixes
- [x] Verify database operations work correctly
