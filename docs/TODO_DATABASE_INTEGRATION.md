√±# Database Integration and Chart Enhancement Plan

## Overview
The application currently has implemented pages but many are using mock data instead of real database connections. This plan outlines the systematic integration of database operations and enhanced chart implementations.

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Prisma schema and migrations are set up
- ‚úÖ Some API routes exist but may need database integration
- ‚úÖ Chart libraries (recharts, chart.js) are installed
- ‚úÖ Some pages have basic charts (analytics, reports, halal-dashboard)
- ‚ùå Most frontend pages use mock/hardcoded data
- ‚ùå Many pages lack comprehensive charts
- ‚ùå API routes may not be fully connected to database

## Tasks

### Phase 1: API Route Database Integration ‚úÖ
- [x] Verify all API routes connect to database properly
- [x] Update backend/api/robots/route.ts - ensure real database queries
- [x] Update backend/api/sensors/route.ts - ensure real database queries
- [x] Update backend/api/storage-management/route.ts - ensure real database queries
- [x] Update backend/api/robot-commands/route.ts - ensure real database queries
- [x] Update backend/api/slotting/replenishment/route.ts - ensure real database queries
- [x] Create missing API routes for other modules (equipment, maintenance, etc.)

### Phase 2: Frontend Database Integration üöß

- [ ] Update app/racks/page.tsx - replace mock data with API calls
- [ ] Update app/cross-docking/page.tsx - replace mock data with API calls
- [ ] Update app/digital-twin/page.tsx - replace mock data with API calls
- [ ] Update app/blockchain/page.tsx - replace mock data with API calls
- [ ] Update app/ipfs/page.tsx - replace mock data with API calls
- [ ] Update app/labor-management/page.tsx - replace mock data with API calls
- [ ] Update app/locations/page.tsx - replace mock data with API calls
- [ ] Update app/alerts/page.tsx - replace mock data with API calls
- [ ] Update app/products/page.tsx - replace mock data with API calls
- [ ] Update app/handling-units/page.tsx - replace mock data with API calls

### Phase 3: Enhanced Chart Implementations üöß
- [x] Add comprehensive charts to app/equipment/page.tsx (via analytics integration)
- [ ] Add comprehensive charts to app/sensors/page.tsx
- [x] Add comprehensive charts to app/maintenance/page.tsx
- [x] Add comprehensive charts to app/robots/page.tsx (already comprehensive)
- [x] Add comprehensive charts to app/inventory/page.tsx
- [ ] Add comprehensive charts to app/operations/page.tsx
- [ ] Add comprehensive charts to app/slotting/page.tsx
- [ ] Add comprehensive charts to app/shipments/page.tsx
- [ ] Add comprehensive charts to app/zones/page.tsx
- [ ] Add comprehensive charts to app/items/page.tsx
- [ ] Add comprehensive charts to app/suppliers/page.tsx
- [ ] Add comprehensive charts to app/transactions/page.tsx
- [ ] Add comprehensive charts to app/waves/page.tsx
- [ ] Add comprehensive charts to app/yard-management/page.tsx
- [ ] Add comprehensive charts to app/quality-inspection/page.tsx
- [ ] Add comprehensive charts to app/racks/page.tsx
- [ ] Add comprehensive charts to app/cross-docking/page.tsx
- [ ] Add comprehensive charts to app/digital-twin/page.tsx
- [ ] Add comprehensive charts to app/blockchain/page.tsx

- [ ] Add comprehensive charts to app/alerts/page.tsx
- [ ] Add comprehensive charts to app/products/page.tsx
- [ ] Add comprehensive charts to app/handling-units/page.tsx

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test database connectivity for all API routes
- [ ] Test frontend-backend data flow
- [ ] Verify chart data accuracy
- [ ] Performance testing for large datasets
- [ ] Error handling validation

## Implementation Strategy
1. Start with Phase 1: Ensure API routes are properly connected to database
2. Move to Phase 2: Update frontend pages to use real API calls
3. Implement Phase 3: Add comprehensive charts to all pages
4. Complete Phase 4: Testing and validation

## Dependencies
- Prisma client properly configured
- Database connection working
- Chart libraries (recharts, chart.js) installed
- API routes following consistent patterns
