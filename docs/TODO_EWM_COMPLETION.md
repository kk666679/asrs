# EWM Enhancement Completion Plan

## Overview
Complete the Extended Warehouse Management (EWM) implementation by adding missing APIs, frontend pages, algorithms, and navigation updates.

## Current Status
- ✅ Partial EWM features implemented (slotting/replenishment, cross-docking, quality-inspection, labor-management/standards)
- ✅ Existing ASRS features operational
- ✅ Database schema has EWM models

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Navigation & Structure Updates
- [ ] Update sidebar navigation with EWM features and sub-features
- [ ] Restructure navigation with clear sections (Core ASRS, EWM Modules, Analytics, etc.)
- [ ] Add proper routing and icons for all EWM features
- [ ] Enable CTAs and buttons directing to respective pages

### Phase 2: Complete API Routes Implementation
- [ ] **Storage Management API** (`/api/storage-management`)

  - Capacity-based optimization

### Phase 5: Service Layer Enhancements
- [ ] Create `lib/services/storage-management.ts`
- [ ] Create `lib/services/yard-management.ts`
- [ ] Create `lib/services/handling-units.ts`
- [ ] Create `lib/services/wave-management.ts`
- [ ] Enhance existing services for EWM integration

### Phase 6: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Integrate all EWM modules with existing ASRS features
- [ ] Test end-to-end workflows
