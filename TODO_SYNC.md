# TODO: Synchronize App, Lib, Components, Hooks, and Backend

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Verify type consistency: Compare lib/types.ts with backend/types.ts and ensure frontend uses shared types
- [x] Update shared utilities: Ensure lib/ functions are used in components/hooks and backend
- [x] Check integrations: Ensure API calls in app/ match backend endpoints, and components/hooks use lib/ properly
- [x] Run builds: Execute npm run build in root (frontend) and backend/ to catch synchronization issues
- [x] Update TODO.md: Mark synchronization as complete or add steps
